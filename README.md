# IRuby

This is a Ruby kernel for IPython/Jupyter and is part of [SciRuby](http://sciruby.com/). You can try it at [try.jupyter.org](http://try.jupyter.org/).

### Quick start
The installation instructions are dividid according to environments mainly because of ZeroMQ.

#### Ubuntu/Debian
At first install IPython/Jupyter. I recommend an installation using virtualenv.

    apt-get install python3-dev virtualenv libzmq3-dev
    virtualenv -p python3 venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install 'ipython[notebook]'

After that, install the Ruby gem.

    gem install rbczmq
    gem install iruby

Now you can run iruby with:

    iruby notebook

#### Windows
At first install IPython/Jupyter. I reccomend an installation using [Enthought Canopy](https://www.enthought.com/).

After that install libzmq.dll (v3.2.x, x86) from [the website of ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/area:download).

Rename `libzmq-v100-mt-3_x_x.dll` to `libzmq.dll`.

Add the path to /bin to the PATH system variable.

Run two commands below:

    gem install ffi-rzmq
    gem install iruby

Now you can run iruby with:

    iruby notebook

#### Mac
I reccomend an installation using [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).
I has not chacked the installation to MacOS X, but four lines below were necessary in v0.1.x.

    conda remove zeromq (If you installed anaconda)
    brew install zeromq
    gem install ffi-rzmq
    gem install iruby

Send us pull-request if you Mac users successed in installing IRuby in another way.

### After the installation

Take a look at the [example notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/SciRuby/sciruby-notebooks/master/getting_started.ipynb)
and the [collection of notebooks](https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby-notebooks/) which includes a Dockerfile to create a containerized installation of iruby
and other scientific gems. You can find the prebuild image at [dockerhub](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/minad/sciruby-notebooks/).
